# Automatic Photo Upload on Edit Product Page

## Summary
Implemented automatic photo upload functionality on the edit product page. When a user chooses a file using the photo input, the photo is automatically uploaded via AJAX without requiring form submission.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend (JavaScript)
**File**: `static/js/edit_product.js`

Added event listener on the photo file input that:
- Validates file type (JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP)
- Validates file size (max 5MB)
- Shows loading indicator using SweetAlert2
- Uploads photo via AJAX using FormData
- Updates image preview automatically upon success
- Displays success/error messages

### 2. Backend (Django View)
**File**: `products/views.py`

Created new view function `upload_product_photo()`:
- Accepts POST requests with multipart/form-data
- Validates file type and size
- Saves photo to product
- Logs the change to EditProductLog
- Returns JSON response with new photo URL

### 3. URL Configuration
**File**: `products/urls.py`

Added new API endpoint:
```python
path('api/upload-photo/<int:product_id>/', views.upload_product_photo, name='api_upload_product_photo')
```

### 4. Template Integration
**File**: `templates/products/edit_product.html`

Added script tag to load the JavaScript file:
```html
<script src="{% static 'js/edit_product.js' %}"></script>
```

## Features

### User Experience
1. **Instant Upload**: Photo uploads immediately when file is selected
2. **Visual Feedback**: Loading spinner during upload
3. **Success Notification**: Sweet alert confirmation when upload succeeds
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid files
5. **Image Preview**: Image updates automatically without page reload
6. **No Form Submission Required**: Photo uploads independently from other form fields

### Validation
- File type validation (image formats only)
- File size validation (max 5MB)
- Server-side validation for security
- User-friendly error messages

### Security
- Login required (@login_required)
- Permission required (@permission_required)
- CSRF token validation
- File type validation on server

### Logging
- All photo changes are logged to EditProductLog
- Includes old and new photo URLs
- Records user who made the change
- Includes timestamp

## Usage

1. Navigate to edit product page: `http://localhost:8000/products/edit/{product_id}/`
2. Click on "Upload/Ganti Photo" file input
3. Choose an image file
4. Photo automatically uploads and preview updates
5. Continue editing other fields as needed
6. Submit form to save other changes

## Technical Notes

- Uses FormData API for file upload
- Implements cache busting with timestamp parameter
- Gracefully handles cases with or without existing photo
- Uses closest() method to find parent card for scoped DOM updates
- Compatible with existing extra barcode functionality
- Doesn't interfere with main form submission

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various image formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP)
2. Test with oversized files (>5MB) to verify rejection
3. Test with non-image files to verify rejection
4. Test photo replacement (when product already has a photo)
5. Test first-time photo upload (when product has no photo)
6. Verify photo appears in product list after upload
7. Check EditProductLog for proper logging

## Files Modified

1. `static/js/edit_product.js` - Added photo upload handler
2. `products/views.py` - Added upload_product_photo() function
3. `products/urls.py` - Added API endpoint route
4. `templates/products/edit_product.html` - Added script inclusion
